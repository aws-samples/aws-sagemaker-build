    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our example introducing Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner Algorithm!  Today, we're analyzing the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset which consists of images of handwritten digits, from zero to nine.  We'll use the individual pixel values from each 28 x 28 grayscale image to predict a yes or no label of whether the digit is a 0 or some other digit (1, 2, 3, ... 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that we'll use is a linear binary classifier.  Linear models are supervised learning algorithms used for solving either classification or regression problems.  As input, the model is given labeled examples ( **`x`**, `y`). **`x`** is a high dimensional vector and `y` is a numeric label.  Since we are doing binary classification, the algorithm expects the label to be either 0 or 1 (but Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner also supports regression on continuous values of `y`).  The algorithm learns a linear function, or linear threshold function for classification, mapping the vector **`x`** to an approximation of the label `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner algorithm extends upon typical linear models by training many models in parallel, in a computationally efficient manner.  Each model has a different set of hyperparameters, and then the algorithm finds the set that optimizes a specific criteria.  This can provide substantially more accurate models than typical linear algorithms at the same, or lower, cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we need to set up the environment with a few prerequisite steps, for permissions, configurations, and so on."
